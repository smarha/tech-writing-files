| Every Aimybox powered voice assistant should use a speech to text and text to speech components to be able to recognise user's speech to the text and then synthesise the resulting text back to the user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Aimybox voice assistants should use speech-to-text and text-to-speech to understand and speak back to users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
